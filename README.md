# Advent of Code 2024 with Deno

My first **Advent of Code**. So hype with the event. I also joined Deno challenge to solve the AOC problem by using Deno. `#aoc-2024-in-deno`  🎄✨

This repository contains my personal solutions to the daily programming challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024). Each day presents a new puzzle to solve, and I'm here to document the journey through code.

## Running the Solutions
```bash
cd day1 #(or any day)

deno test --allow-read
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Deno 2.1**
- **TypeScript**

Feel free to explore, learn, and share your thoughts on the solutions!

Happy Coding and Happy Holidays! 🎉
